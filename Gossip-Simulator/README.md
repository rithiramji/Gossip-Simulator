Gossip-Simulator
=================

* The project determines the convergence of Gossip type algorithms through a simulator using the Scala Actor Model.

* The algorithms has been implemented for various topologies (Full,Grid,Line and Imperfect Grid) and different sizes.

* The Running times were calculated and analyzed. 

* A crash failure model has also been implemented.
